# Test-for-Netguru
TC10 &amp; TC13

These are my first automated tests in Cypress and the first ones I'm sharing on Github.

If you have Cypress installed, in the folder Cypress > integration > examples paste the files from the repository. Additionally, I have configuration files (package.json, package-lock.json, .prettierrc) that need to be placed in the code editor.

In Visual Studio Code or another code editor, open the tests, then in the terminal type "nmp run cy:open" and click enter to have Cypress automatically run. 

From the examples folder, select the test you are interested in (TC10 or TC13) to run it.
